description: Run the speckit preparation phases end-to-end — specify, plan, critique, tasks — making all decisions autonomously. Stops before implementation.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

You are running the **preparation phases of the speckit pipeline** end-to-end. The user's input (above) is the feature description that will seed the specification phase.

This skill is the prefix of `speckit-opsmill-auto`: it covers Specify → Plan → Critique → Tasks → Spec/Ask Alignment Check and **stops before implementation**. Use it when you want a feature fully designed and broken down into a `tasks.md` ready for review, but you do not want the agent to execute the tasks autonomously.

Execute every phase below **in order**, making all decisions autonomously. Do not stop to ask the user for input between phases — if a phase requires choices (e.g., clarification questions in specify, research decisions in plan), use your best judgment and proceed. The user expects a hands-off, one-shot execution up through `tasks.md`.

After **each phase**, invoke the `speckit-checkpoint-commit` skill to commit the artifacts produced by that phase before moving on.

> Each phase below is executed by invoking the named skill (e.g. via the agent's Skill tool). Skills are agent-agnostic, so this workflow runs identically across any harness that supports skill discovery — not only those exposing speckit slash commands.

### Phase 1 — Specify

Invoke the `speckit-specify` skill with the user's feature description (`$ARGUMENTS`).

- Complete the full specify workflow: generate a short name, create the spec directory, write `spec.md`, run quality checks.
- If clarification questions arise, answer them yourself based on context and best judgment — do **not** pause for user input.
- Commit the spec artifacts.

### Phase 2 — Plan

Invoke the `speckit-plan` skill.

- Complete the full plan workflow: research unknowns, generate `plan.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`, API contracts, `quickstart.md`.
- Make all design decisions autonomously.
- Commit the plan artifacts.

### Phase 3 — Critique

Run the dual-lens (Product + Engineering) critique against `spec.md` and `plan.md` before any tasks are generated.

**Resolve the critique provider first.** Record the answer as `CRITIQUE_MODE`, the same way Phase 0 of `speckit-opsmill-implement` resolves `REVIEW_MODE`. Run this check from the repository root and read `CRITIQUE_MODE` off its output — do not decide from memory:

```bash
if [ -d .specify/extensions/critique ] || grep -q '"critique"' .specify/extensions/.registry 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "critique extension: installed"
else
  echo "critique extension: missing"
fi
```

| Check output | `CRITIQUE_MODE` |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `installed` | `extension` |
| `missing`, and you can dispatch clean-context subagents | `fallback` |
| `missing`, and no subagent dispatch is available | `none` |

Both signals are written by `specify extension add` itself, and neither is harness-specific — do not key the decision off `.claude/skills/speckit-critique-run/`, which only exists under Claude Code. Resolve this by **checking the filesystem**, not by asking yourself whether you "have" the skill. A missing critique provider never blocks the run; it selects the branch below and it is reported on the status line.

**3a — `CRITIQUE_MODE: extension`.** Invoke the `speckit-critique-run` skill. If that invocation fails — the skill is not found, or it errors out without returning findings — the extension is present on disk but not usable. Downgrade to `CRITIQUE_MODE: fallback` and run 3b, or to `none` if no subagent dispatch is available, and report the mode that actually ran.

**3b — `CRITIQUE_MODE: fallback`.** Dispatch **one** clean-context subagent to run the same dual-lens critique. Brief it self-contained: absolute paths to `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and the resolved project context files, plus the required return shape — findings tagged 🎯 Must-Address, 💡 Recommendation, or 🤔 Question, and a verdict of `PROCEED` or `RETHINK`. Findings only; the subagent must not edit the spec or plan. Reduced depth compared with the extension, so flag it in Completion rather than presenting it as an equivalent pass.

**3c — `CRITIQUE_MODE: none`.** Skip the critique and proceed to Phase 4 with no findings. Never describe the run as critiqued, and do not substitute an unstructured reread of `spec.md` for the critique.

**Finding handling is identical in 3a and 3b:**

- For any 🎯 **Must-Address** findings, apply the suggested fixes to `spec.md` / `plan.md` autonomously and commit them — do not pause for user approval.
- For 💡 Recommendations, apply them when the fix is clear and low-risk; otherwise note and move on.
- 🤔 Questions: resolve with your best judgment based on context (same rule as the Specify phase).
- If the verdict is 🛑 **RETHINK**, loop back to `speckit-plan` (or `speckit-specify` if the spec itself is the problem), re-run the critique, then continue.
- Commit the critique report and any spec/plan updates before moving on.

### Phase 4 — Tasks

Invoke the `speckit-tasks` skill.

- Generate the full `tasks.md` with dependency-ordered, actionable tasks.
- Skip the optional `speckit-analyze` skill unless something looks inconsistent — use your judgment.
- Commit the tasks artifact.

### Phase 5 — Spec/Ask Alignment Check

The earlier phases can drift from a detailed PRD: clarifications get over-applied, scope creeps in from research, or requirements get rephrased away. This phase catches that before the user sees `tasks.md`.

#### 5a. Decide whether to run the check

Inspect `$ARGUMENTS`. The check is **only meaningful when the user provided a substantive PRD** — either inline or by reference. Decide based on the following, in order:

1. **`$ARGUMENTS` contains one or more URLs** (links to a Notion / Confluence / Google Doc / GitHub issue / Linear ticket / shared Markdown / PDF). Treat each URL as a likely PRD location. **Run the check.**
2. **`$ARGUMENTS` itself looks like a detailed PRD** — multiple paragraphs with structure such as headings, bullet lists of requirements, explicit goals/non-goals, acceptance criteria, or > ~400 characters of substantive description. **Run the check.**
3. **`$ARGUMENTS` is a one-line description, vague brief, or empty.** **Skip the check** — there is no source-of-truth document to align against. Write a short note in your final summary stating you skipped this phase and why, and proceed to Completion. If the input is short (under ~400 characters) but still carries substantive, requirement-bearing detail, use your judgment and treat it as a PRD under rule 2 rather than skipping.

#### 5b. Resolve the source-of-truth PRD

If you decided to run the check:

- For each URL in `$ARGUMENTS`, fetch its content using the harness's web fetch tool (in Claude Code: the `WebFetch` tool). Extract the requirement-bearing sections.
- **If the harness has no web-fetch capability at all** (the tool is absent, not merely failing): you cannot resolve URL-only PRDs. Fall back to any inline PRD content in `$ARGUMENTS`. If the only source was a URL and there is no inline content, you cannot run a meaningful check — skip the rest of Phase 5, record `verdict: ⚠️ SKIPPED — source PRD unreachable (no web-fetch tool)` in the alignment report, and note it prominently in the Completion summary so the user knows alignment was not verified.
- If a URL is gated (auth required, 404, network error), record that and fall back to whatever PRD content is in `$ARGUMENTS` itself. If neither is usable, skip the rest of Phase 5 with a note.
- Concatenate the fetched / inline PRD content into a single "source PRD" view that you will compare against `spec.md`.

#### 5c. Compare source PRD to `spec.md`

Read the current `spec.md` end-to-end and judge it against the source PRD. You are looking for **significant** drift, not stylistic differences. Significant means:

- A requirement, goal, or explicit non-goal in the PRD is **missing** from the spec.
- The spec **adds** a requirement, scope item, or constraint that does **not** appear in the PRD and was not a necessary clarification.
- A requirement's semantics have been **changed** (e.g., "users can opt out" became "admins can opt users out"; "must support 10k req/s" became "should scale").
- Acceptance criteria in the PRD are **dropped** or **softened** in the spec.
- The spec contradicts a stated PRD constraint (compatibility, deadline, dependency, etc.).

Cosmetic, structural, or expansion-of-detail differences are **not** drift. The spec is allowed to be longer, more precise, and to flesh out implicit requirements.

#### 5d. Write the alignment report

Write `<spec-dir>/alignment-check.md` with:

1. **Source** — which URL(s) and / or inline ask were used as the source PRD.
2. **Verdict** — one of `✅ ALIGNED`, `⚠️ MINOR DRIFT (proceeding)`, or `🛑 SIGNIFICANT DRIFT (re-running prep)`.
3. **Findings** — table of `Severity | Category (missing / added / changed / dropped / contradicted) | PRD reference | Spec reference | Description`.
4. **Action** — what you decided to do (proceed, or re-run which phases).

Commit the report via `speckit-checkpoint-commit`.

#### 5e. Remediate significant drift (with retry budget)

This step is the **loop body**. Initialize a remediation counter to `0` before the first entry. Enter this step whenever the most recent 5d verdict is `🛑 SIGNIFICANT DRIFT`.

While the latest verdict is `🛑 SIGNIFICANT DRIFT`:

1. **Check the budget first.** If the counter is already `2`, do **not** start another pass — go to "budget exhausted" below.
2. **Increment the counter** (this pass now counts against the budget of 2).
3. **Update `spec.md`** by re-invoking the `speckit-specify` skill with an augmented input that includes:
   - The original `$ARGUMENTS` content (and fetched PRD body if from URL).
   - An explicit list of the drift findings the spec must fix (missing requirements to add, off-scope items to remove, semantic changes to revert).
   The skill will update the existing `spec.md` in place.
4. **Re-run Phase 2 (Plan)** to refresh `plan.md` against the corrected spec.
5. **Re-run Phase 3 (Critique)** to validate the corrected spec/plan.
6. **Re-run Phase 4 (Tasks)** to regenerate `tasks.md` against the corrected plan.
7. **Re-run Phase 5c–5d** (do **not** re-resolve the source PRD — keep the same source) to produce a fresh verdict, then return to the top of this loop and re-evaluate it.

**Loop exits:**

- **Aligned/minor** — a pass produces `✅ ALIGNED` or `⚠️ MINOR DRIFT`: accept it and proceed to Completion.
- **Budget exhausted** — the counter reached `2` and the verdict is still `🛑 SIGNIFICANT DRIFT`: stop. Update `alignment-check.md` with verdict `🛑 UNRESOLVED — manual review required`, list the remaining findings, and surface this prominently in the Completion summary. Do **not** silently proceed.

**Retry budget**: at most **2 remediation passes**, tracked by the counter above.

Commit each remediation pass's artifacts as it runs (the inner skills handle their own commits; you only need to commit the updated `alignment-check.md` at the end of each pass).

## Completion

After all five phases are complete, provide a brief summary:

- Feature name and spec directory
- Number of tasks generated in `tasks.md`
- Any critique findings that were addressed inline, and the `CRITIQUE_MODE` used. State a `fallback` or `none` mode plainly, with the install hint `specify extension add critique`
- **Alignment check status** — verdict, source PRD reference, number of remediation passes used (if any), and any unresolved drift
- Any notable decisions you made autonomously

**Machine-readable status line (REQUIRED).** The **final line** of your output MUST be exactly:

`STATUS: <READY|BLOCKED> | SPEC_DIR: <absolute spec-dir path> | CRITIQUE: <extension|fallback|none|n/a> | REASON: <short reason or n/a>`

- `STATUS: READY` — `tasks.md` was generated **and** the alignment outcome is `✅ ALIGNED`, `⚠️ MINOR DRIFT`, or `⚠️ SKIPPED`. Only in this state is the spec safe to implement.
- `STATUS: BLOCKED` — alignment is `🛑 UNRESOLVED` after the retry budget, or any phase could not complete. This is the explicit failure signal the parent `speckit-opsmill-auto` checks before deciding whether to start implementation; do not dress an unresolved run up as a success.
- `SPEC_DIR` MUST be the absolute path to the spec directory, so the parent can hand it to the implement phase without parsing prose.
- `CRITIQUE` mirrors the `CRITIQUE_MODE` resolved in Phase 3, so the parent never has to infer critique coverage from prose. A degraded mode does **not** make the run `BLOCKED` — the spec is still implementable — but it MUST be reported. Use `CRITIQUE: n/a` only when the run aborted before Phase 3.

**Why `CRITIQUE: none` reports but does not block, while `REVIEW: none` forces `INCOMPLETE` in `speckit-opsmill-implement`.** The two gates fail differently. A missing critique leaves the spec un-pressure-tested, but `spec.md` and `tasks.md` are read by a human before any code is written, so the gap is visible at the next step and closing it costs a re-run of prep. A missing review leaves already-written code unexamined, and the implement report is the only thing that speaks to whether that code is sound — nothing downstream re-checks it, so a `DONE` there would assert an assurance that was never produced. Prep therefore degrades and reports; `implement` degrades and marks the run `INCOMPLETE`.

Keep this as the literal last line, unwrapped.

Do **not** proceed to implementation, review, or extraction. The user will run those phases (or `speckit-opsmill-auto` from scratch) when ready.
